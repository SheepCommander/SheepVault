1. Why did the Allies win WW2
	   - More ppl, money, and materials (USSR & US)
	   - The Homefront was united, supportive, and sacrificed
	   - The men that fought believed in what they were doing (morality)
	   - Fighting to free people -- not to subjugate them (populations on Allies' side)
2. Costs
	- Casualties (estimated 40-60 Million ppl died around the world- civilians & soldiers)
	- US: 290,000 dead
		  670,000 wounded
		  100,000 dead from industrial accidents at home
	- Financial costs were incalculable
	- Failed Morality
		- revealed worst in human nature
		- Holocaust, bombing & slaughter of civilians, atomic bomb, POW camps
		- Science, technology, and reason were all used to make the future & present worse. Progress and technology were not automatically used to promote morality and preservation of humanity.
3. Status of the US
	- Most militarily powerful and wealthiest nation on earth - no damage on the homefront
	- Troops stationed around the world - Germany & Japan
	- Soviets are powerful militarily in spite of the damage and casualties (20 million dead)
4. United Nations & Collective Security
	- Established and pushed by FDR
	- Different than post-WW1 when US did not approve League of Nations
	- "COLLECTIVE SECURITY" World Police Force to stop conflict and potential WWIIII
	- Need for great powers to cooperate - Security Council
5. Demobilization
	- Troops are left around the globe but must soldiers want to, and do, come home
	- 12 million troops down to 3 million
	- Before WWII only 300,000
	- U.S. wants to preserve a presence around the world
	- Millions coming home need jobs and support
	- Women will be asked to go back home - be restricted to housewives and mothers again
	- Men want to return to better jobs than they had before - GI Bill - preference in government jobs, loans for houses, loans for businesses, and free college/education
	- Baby Boom
