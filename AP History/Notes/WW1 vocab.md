1. Unrestricted Submarine Warfare

Unrestricted submarine warfare refers to Germany’s policy of attacking all ships --- merchant or passenger --- with submarine torpedoes. German High Command believed that the unrestricted use of submarines on commerce ships would allow them to win the war against England, and these attacks were the most important factor in making the U.S. join world war one.

2. Zimmermann Note

The Zimmermann Note (Telegram) was an intercepted secret note from Germany to Mexico, saying that in exchange for Mexican alliance Germany would help Mexico regain former territories of California, New Mexico, and the one I forgot.
This note sealed Germany’s fate, so to speak, by confirming to the U.S. without a doubt that Germany was not a friend and Germany was already prepared for war with America.

3. Selective-Service Act (look outside the textbook)

The Selective Service Act of 1917 authorized the US government to raise a national army for service in World War I through conscription. Specifically, the act set guidelines that required all males aged 21 to 30 to register to be potentially selected for military service, later expanded to 18~45 in August 1918.
This was important because of the 4.8 million Americans who served in the armed forces, 2.8 million had been drafted, and half (or more) of the American army wouldn’t have existed without the draft and the registration.

4. War Industries Board and National War Labor Board

The War Industries Board (headed by Bernard Baruck, a Wall Street broker) set production priorities and established centralized control of raw materials and prices.
The National War Labor Board (headed by former president William Howard Taft) settled disputes between workers and employers, winning labor concessions that had been previously denied. Wages rose, the eight hour workday became more common, and union membership increased.
These were important agencies established by President Woodrow Wilson’s (“progressive”?) policy to support and streamline the war effort.

5. Committee on Public Information

The Committee on Public Information was a propaganda agency which enlisted voluntary services of artists, writers, performers, and movie stars to depict the heroism of American soldiers and the villainy of the kaiser.
The Committee was important for producing war propaganda and a public patriotic spirit, which led to only 350,000 of the drafted evading the draft.

The U.S. government used techniques of both patriotic persuasion and legal
intimidation to ensure public support for the war effort. Journalist George
Creel took charge of a propaganda agency called the Committee on Public
Information, which enlisted the voluntary services of artists, writers, vaude
ville performers, and movie stars to depict the heroism of the "boys" (U.S.
soldiers) and the villainy of the kaiser. They created films, posters, pamphlets,
and volunteer speakers-all urging Americans to watch out for German spies
and to "do your bit" for the war.

6. Sedition Act

The Sedition Act outlawed making “disloyal” or “abusive” remarks about the U.S. government, prosecuting 2,000 and jailing half. The Sedition Act, and the Espionage Act, are important to the enforcement of pro-war public support and the silencing of dissent to the war.

The Espionage Act (1917) provided for imprisonment of up to 20 years for persons who either tried to incite
rebellion in the armed forces or obstruct the operation of the draft. The Sedition
Act (1918) went much further by prohibiting anyone from making "disloyal"
or "abusive" remarks about the U.S. government. About 2,000 people were
prosecuted under these laws, half of whom were convicted and jailed. Among
them was the Socialist leader Eugene Debs, who was sentenced to ten years in
federal prison for speaking against the war.

7. Great Migration

The great migration 1914 to 1940 (& 1941~1970) was when many African Americans left the South due to discrimination, job opportunities, or bad crops (weevil infestation) and led to significant demographic changes in northern cities, expanding African American communities and leading to race riots in the north.
The Great Migration is important because of the jobs that were filled by the immigrants, the significant impact on national demographics, and the later Harlem Renaissance and civil rights movement.

8. League of Nations and the Debate over the Treaty of Versailles (link)

The League of Nations was the, infamously incompetent, predecessor of the United Nations. The Treaty of Versailles ended war between the allies and Germany.

The debate over the treaty of versailles between “isolationists” and Wilsonian internationalists (named after President Wilson) was important because it represented the division of attitude in the country and led to  the treaty of versailles becoming the only treaty to be rejected by the senate not just once, but twice.

Aside from isolationists and internationalists, there were also those who wanted to add reservations to the treaties, called “reservationists”, making the Senate a three-way split in opinion.
