# Allergen Avoidance
## Pollens: 🌿
**Trees** Feb-Apr
**Grasses** May-Aug
**Weeds** Aug-Oct

Pollen grains produced by plants are displaced in the wind and are easily inhaled to cause allergy symptoms. Because of their shape, pollen may travel as far as 40 miles and fill the air during the spring, summer, and fall.

Because pollen counts are highest in the morning, patients are advised to wait to the late afternoon before spending any prolonged time outside. If you are outside for an extended period of time, please wash your hands and face or shower.
Avoid cutting grass and being outside while your neighbor cuts his lawn, but if not practical, make sure to wear a mask and sunglasses to keep pollen out of your nose and eyes.

Wash your hair and clothes at night to avoid taking pollen to bed and consider placing a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in the bedroom. During pollen seasons, it is helpful to keep windows closed and use the air conditioner.
In addition to keeping your windows car windows closed, use the recycled air button on the car air conditioner.

## Mold:
> [!quote]- Mold ☘️
> Nearly year-round until the first-frost. Mold reproduces by forming tiny, invisible spores that "pop off" into the air where they may be inhaled. Mold usually grows in warm, dark, moist environments and can be found in hay, mulch, leaf piles and compost. Mold counts are usually highest in humid weather and classically spike after a heavy rain.
> 
> Damp basements and damp bathrooms are common indoor mold reservoirs along with potted plants, refrigerator pans, and water-damaged wallboard, carpets, etc. Avoiding mold growth in the home may be accomplished by minimizing indoor humidity and repairing any sources of water damage. Dehumidifiers work well and should be used to keep the humidity less than 50%. Avoid using humidifiers, but if necessary, they should be cleaned regularly to prevent their collection basin from growing mold, which can be killed with bleach solutions, available in most grocery stores.
> 
> Leaks and flooded areas should be cleaned and dried within 24 hours. Around the house, avoid raking leaves or even cutting grass as both may contain mold. Although we can never completely avoid mold, a deeper understanding of where mold grows and how to remove it can make all the difference in minimizing symptoms in allergic individuals. *(Reference image of a moldy window-wall corner)*
## Dust mite:
Year round.
The dust mite is an extremely common, microscopic, insect-like creature that is responsible for causing house dust allergy. Found in even the cleanest of homes, dust mites thrive in pillows, mattresses, carpet, upholstered furniture, stuffed animals and clothing. They feed on our shed skin, the main component of dust. Dust mite excrement represents the true allergen and is easily inhaled upon close contact. The allergen is heavy and usually settled on surfaces so is not easily removed by room air purifiers or by standard vacuum cleaners.

Specially designed dust mite encasings that completely enclose pillows, mattress, and box springs help to trap the mites inside and keep them from triggering allergy symptoms. Even pillows labeled "allergy free" should be covered. Comfortable dust mite covers that lack a plastic feel can be purchased at local stores or online. Regular sheets go over the encasings - sheets get washed in hot water (over 130 degrees) **every week** while the encasings themselves stay put for **6 months** or so. Avoid hanging bed sheets on an outdoor clothes line to dry as pollen and mold will accumulate on them. And to prevent further contamination, store bedding in plastic or tight drawers. Carpet provides a significant reservoir for dust mites and, ideally, should be removed from the bedroom. If removal is not practical, carpet should be cleaned twice a week with a vacuum fitted with special allergy bags with tight filters or a cyclonic vacuum. High humidity not only encourages mold growth but increases dust mite reproduction. So avoid humidifiers and attempt to maintain bedroom humidity levels below 50%.

Other import dust reducing measures in the bedroom include:
- Vacuum frequently.
- Avoid using ceiling fans.
- Close or place a guard over the bedroom vent.
- Avoid stuffed animals and decorative pillows. If not, dust mites can be killed by placing contaminated objects in the freezer for 24-48 hrs or by machine washing in the hot cycle.
- Simplify and remove clutter from the area around the head of the bed and the bedside table.
- Dust daily with a damp cloth or a commercial dusting product.
- Avoid using bookcase headboards with decorative items.
- The head of the bed should not be placed against the window.
- Keep closet doors shut.
- Avoid venetian blinds, grass wallpaper, and wicker furniture since they are difficult to keep dust-free.

> [!Success]- Allergy Avoidance In The Bedroom
> Because most people spend nearly one-third of each 24-hour day in bed, environmental control measures focus first on the bedroom.
> 1. Enclose pillows in zippered, dust-proof (vinyl) covers. Encase mattresses and box springs in zippered, dust-proof (vinyl) covers. Wash sheets and pillow cases weekly at 130F or greater.
> 2. Wash blankets in hot water (130F or greater) every two weeks. (Replace wool or down blankets with a type such as Vellux that can withstand repeated hot water washings.)
> 3. Dust around the head of your bed with a commercial dusting product (e.g., Pledge, Endust) or a damp cloth every day. (It only takes a minute!)
> 4. Use window shades instead of heavy curtains and venetian blinds. Launder curtains frequently if you use them in the room.
> 5. Dust drawers and closets regularly with a damp cloth. A dust and pollen filter mask may be used for housecleaning and making the bed.
> 6. Use wooden or plastic furniture instead of upholstered pieces.
> 7. Avoid dust-collecting room decor (pennants, macreme, hangings, etc.)
> 8. Keep clothing in a closet with the door shut.
> 9. Air conditioners reduce the heat and humidity that stimulate mite (and mold) growth. Use a dehumidifier in a damp basement.
> 10. Maintain relative humidity at 40-50%. (Use a humidity gauge.) Mites grow best at 75-80% relative humidity and cannot live at humidity below 50%. Avoid over humidification in the winter.
> 11. Consider filter covers for air vents.
> 12. Room HEPA air cleaners can remove airborne dust particles effectively.
## Dog/Cat:
Pets provide companionship and fun, but for some people a dog or cat can also trigger sneezing, sniffles, and worse. There is a myth that pet allergies are triggered by animal hair, but they are actually triggered by a protein found in pet skin (or dander), saliva, and urine. Some dog breeds are labeled "hypoallergenic", as they shed less, but no dog is 100% hypoallergenic---even hairless dogs still have some allergen.[^1]
Each animal is different, and a particular pet allergy sufferer may do better with one breed than another. If you're allergic and want to get a cat or dog, consider looking for breeds with less shedding, although there isn't real scientific evidence this will help. Some allergists have suggested that a dog that tends to keep its coat throughout the year may be better for allergy sufferers. Other factors, such as your pet's disposition, might make frequent bathing more feasible.

Things you can do to reduce suffering from pet allergies:
- Make your bedroom a pet-free space, and wash bedding in hot water.
- Bathe your pet frequently and have a non-allergic person perform grooming to reduce dander and hair shedding.
- Use a HEPA air purifier/filter to trap dander.
- Clean carpeting frequently, or opt for wood, tile, or linoleum flooring.
- Keep your pet outside when possible.
- Keep your pet off the furniture---cover upholstered chairs with towels and sheets and wash them on a regular basis.
- If your dog rides in the car, use covers on the seats and wash them frequently.
There's no guarantee that someone who is truly allergic to pets will tolerate living with a dog or cat. If you're thinking about getting a pet, but are concerned about allergies, consider trying one out on a trial basis. You can also begin allergy treatment before getting a pet, including allergy shots such as for cats.

## I
**Cockroach/Mouse/Pests:** Cockroach allergen can cause significant symptoms in some people, especially those with asthma. Eradication strategies include aggressive caulking of the tracks or gaps around piping and other openings, particularly in apartment buildings or condominiums where cockroaches and rodents can enter and move from one unit to another. Controlling access to food in the kitchen and throughout the rest of the home is a major aspect of cockroach and rodent control. Food should be fully enclosed or kept in a refrigerator. No waste should be kept in the home, and dishes or pans should not be left out with any food debris on their surfaces. If a pest infestation is significant, it is recommended that a professional pest manager service is used. 

**Feathers:** Please avoid feather pillows and feather comforters. Please do not have a bird as a pet.

**Irritants:** while not allergens, many irritants/triggers can exacerbate symptoms in individuals
- Smoke- it is well established that breathing secondhand smoke causes problems in allergic individuals and others. Smoking should not be allowed in the house, in the car, or in the work place. Opening a window does not eliminate smoke sufficiently to make it acceptable.
- Odors- stay away from strong odors such as perfume, hair spray, paint, cooking exhaust, cleaning products, and insecticides. Room air refresheners and electronic air cleaners also can trigger symptoms.
- Cold air - Cover your nose and mouth with a scarf.
- Colds and infections - Wash hands regularly.
- Exhaust - if you have an attached garage, don't start the car and let it run in there. Fumes can make their way into the home even when the garage door is open.
