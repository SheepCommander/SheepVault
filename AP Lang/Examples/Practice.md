> [!Quote]- "While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to the world, what our motives and our objects are."
> -- Woodrow Wilson, "President Woodrow Wilson Presents an Ideal to the War Congress"
1. This is a periodic sentence, in which the subject and verb are delayed until the final part of the sentence. This creates syntactic tension and emphasizes the ideas at the end of the sentence. What ideas are stressed in this periodic sentence?

2. If the sentence was rewritten "Our motives and objects must be clear to all the world while we ..." the stress is lost and 'deeply momentous things' feels unimportant.

**Apply: Using Wilson's sentence as a model, write a periodic sentence about music censorship.** When we, in our wisdom and concern, do contrive to protect wet ears, it comes out that false morality and polite gestures behead honesty.

> [!Quote]- "Brother, continue to listen. You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind; and if we do not take hold of the religion you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost. How do we know this to be true?"
> -- Chief Red Jacket, "Chief Red Jacket Rejects a Change of Religion"
1. The words 'you say' are repeated several times in the sentence.

2. The question at the passage's end is a rhetorical question. What attitude toward the audience is expressed by the use of a rhetorical question?

**Apply: Write a three-sentence paragraph modeled after Chief Red Jacket's passage. The first two sentences should contain repetition; the third sentence should be a rhetorical question. Your topic is school uniforms.**

> [!Quote]- "Whenever he was so fortunate as to have near him a hare that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made with rancid butter, he gorged himself with such violence that his veins swelled, and the moisture broke out on his forehead."
> --Thomas Babington Macaulay, "Samuel Johnson"

1. What effect does the detail (the spoiled hare, the rancid butter, the swollen veins, the sweaty forehead) have on the reader?

2. How would the meaning of the sentence be changed by ending it after *himself*?

**Apply: Write a sentence describing someone with disgusting eating habits. It must be one correct sentence; it must contain at least three vivid details.**
- The entire room became moist with each cold, damp, crunch of his teeth.

> [!Quote]- "Abuelito under a **bald**" light bulb, under a ceiling **dusty** with flies, puffs his cigar and counts money soft and wrinkled as old Kleenex.
> --Sandra Cisneros, "Tepeyac," Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories

1. How can a ceiling be *dusty* with flies? Are the flies plentiful or sparse? Active or still? Clustered or evenly distributed?

2. What does Cisneros mean by a *bald* light bulb? What does this reveal about Abuelito's room?

**Apply: Take Cisneros's phrase, *under a ceiling dusty with flies,* and write a new phrase by substituting the word *dusty* with a different aedjective. Explain to a partner the impact of your new adjective on the sentence.**
