> [!Quote]- "While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to the world, what our motives and our objects are."
> -- Woodrow Wilson, "President Woodrow Wilson Presents an Ideal to the War Congress"
1. This is a periodic sentence, in which the subject and verb are delayed until the final part of the sentence. This creates syntactic tension and emphasizes the ideas at the end of the sentence. What ideas are stressed in this periodic sentence?

2. If the sentence was rewritten "Our motives and objects must be clear to all the world while we ..." the stress is lost and 'deeply momentous things' feels unimportant.

**Apply: Using Wilson's sentence as a model, write a periodic sentence about music censorship.** When we, in our wisdom and concern, do contrive to protect wet ears, it comes out that false morality and polite gestures behead honesty.

> [!Quote]- "Brother, continue to listen. You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind; and if we do not take hold of the religion you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost. How do we know this to be true?"
> -- Chief Red Jacket, "Chief Red Jacket Rejects a Change of Religion"
1. The words 'you say' are repeated several times in the sentence.

2. The question at the passage's end is a rhetorical question. What attitude toward the audience is expressed by the use of a rhetorical question?

**Apply: Write a three-sentence paragraph modeled after Chief Red Jacket's passage. The first two sentences should contain repetition; the third sentence should be a rhetorical question. Your topic is school uniforms.**

> [!Quote]- "Whenever he was so fortunate as to have near him a hare that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made with rancid butter, he gorged himself with such violence that his veins swelled, and the moisture broke out on his forehead."
> --Thomas Babington Macaulay, "Samuel Johnson"

1. What effect does the detail (the spoiled hare, the rancid butter, the swollen veins, the sweaty forehead) have on the reader?

2. How would the meaning of the sentence be changed by ending it after *himself*?

**Apply: Write a sentence describing someone with disgusting eating habits. It must be one correct sentence; it must contain at least three vivid details.**
- The entire room became moist with each cold, damp, crunch of his teeth.

> [!Quote]- "Abuelito under a **bald**" light bulb, under a ceiling **dusty** with flies, puffs his cigar and counts money soft and wrinkled as old Kleenex.
> --Sandra Cisneros, "Tepeyac," Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories

1. How can a ceiling be *dusty* with flies? Are the flies plentiful or sparse? Active or still? Clustered or evenly distributed?

2. What does Cisneros mean by a *bald* light bulb? What does this reveal about Abuelito's room?

**Apply: Take Cisneros's phrase, *under a ceiling dusty with flies,* and write a new phrase by substituting the word *dusty* with a different aedjective. Explain to a partner the impact of your new adjective on the sentence.**

> [!Quote]- "Indeed, it strikes me that to lay this obscenity off to some mitigating factor, no matter how worthy, is to make the crime smaller than it is and offer rationalizations that insult the sufferers. <Br><Br>Meaning that I don't care what video games these wretches played. Don't give a damn if they were picked on by other kids. <Br><Br> It makes no difference.<Br><Br>This was a special category of evil."
> --Leonard Pitts, Jr., "Why? Maybe It's a Blessing Not to Know Why Those Two Boys Did It"

1. What is Pitts' attitude toward the perpetrators of the crimes in Littleton, CO? What words reveal his attitude?

2. In the second paragraph of this passage, Pitts uses two incomplete sentences. How does his syntax contribute to the tone?

**Apply: Think of an issue for which you have a decided opinion. Write a paragraph defending this opinion. Create a tone of righteous indignation. Use at least one incomplete sentence to help create your tone.**

> [!Quote]- "Art is the **antidote** that can call us back from the edge of numbness, restoring the ability to feel for another."
> --Barbara Kingsolver, High Tide in Tucson

1. By using the word *antidote*, what does the author imply about the inability to feel for another?

2. If we changed the word *antidote* to *gift*, what effect would it have on the meaning of the sentence?
A gift is not a basic necessity/natural, but something that improves our life.

**Apply: Brainstorm with the class and develop a list of medical terms; then write a sentence using a medical term to characterize art. Explain to the class the effect this term has on the meaning of the sentence.**
- Art is not a cheap anesthetic to be prescribed, art is a vaccine against indifference.

> [!Quote]- "Certainly we must face this fact: if the American press, as a mass medium, has formed the minds of America, the mass has also formed the medium. There is action, reaction, and interaction going on ceaselessly between the newspaper-buying public and the editors. What is wrong with the American press is what is in part wrong with American society.<br><br>Is this, then, to exonerate the American press for its failures to give the American people more tasteful and more illuminating reading matter? Can the American press seek to be excused from responsibility for public lack of information as TV and radio often do, on the grounds that, after all, 'we have to give the people what they want or we will go out of business'?"
> -- Clare Boothe Luce, "What's Wrong with the American Press?"

1. What is Luce's attitude about the American press?
2. How does the use of rhetorical questions help express this attitude? In other words, how do the rhetorical questions set the tone?
**Apply: Write an answer to the rhetorical questions in this passage. Adopt a tone of *sneering derision* as you express the attitude that the American press can indeed by excused from responsibility in order to make more money. Use at least one rhetorical question in your reply.**
- Why, of course, it is wholly unreasonable to expect

> [!Quote]- "There is another curious class of cases in which close external resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habitats of life, but has been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to the wonderful manner in which certain butterflies imitate... other and quite distinct species... The mockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find an imitator living remote from the form which it imitates. The mockers are almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case abound in swarms."
> -- Charles Darwin, "Analogical Resemblances," The Origin of Species

1. Why does Darwin use a semicolon rather than a period in the last two sentences of this passage?
2. What effect does the sentence structure have on the meaning of the passage?

**Apply: Write a sentence with two independent clauses describing two schools in your area. Join the two clauses with a semicolon. The two clauses should emphasize the differences between the two schools. Remember not to use a conjunction to join the two clauses.**
- Shorewood may have to change their mascot which was deemed offensive; Shorecrest was allowed to keep theirs.
- Cascade K-8 has a strong sense of community; Shoreline is most impersonal.
