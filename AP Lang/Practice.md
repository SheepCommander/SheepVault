1. This is a periodic sentence, in which the subject and verb are delayed until the final part of the sentence. This creates syntactic tension and emphasizes the ideas at the end of the sentence. What ideas are stressed in this periodic sentence?
The motivations of the U.S. during the war.

2. If the sentence was rewritten "Our motives and objects must be clear to all the world while we ..." the stress is lost and 'deeply momentous things' feels unimportant.

**Apply: Using Wilson's sentence as a model, write a periodic sentence about music censorship.** When we, in our wisdom and concern, do contrive to protect wet ears, it comes out that false morality and polite gestures behead honesty.

You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind; and if we do not take hold of the religion you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost. How do we know this to be true?"

1. The words 'you say' are repeated several times in the sentence.
The repetition emphasizes your **speech** without **proof**.
2. The question at the passage's end is a rhetorical question. What attitude toward the audience is expressed by the use of a rhetorical question?
That they have not proven it.

**Apply: Write a three-sentence paragraph modeled after Chief Red Jacket's passage. The first two sentences should contain repetition; the third sentence should be a rhetorical question. Your topic is school uniforms.**
