###### Situate the issue in a broader context
- For **rhetorical analysis,** we discuss the historical significance of the text, especially when reading speeches. Depending on the passage, we’ll discuss the extent to which the message or argument still applies today or the extent to which the changes the speaker desired have taken effect.

- For **synthesis or argument,** we’ll discuss the short-term and long-term effects on society. If applicable, we’ll discuss relevant personal experience or outside knowledge of the topic. The goal is to help students to think beyond what the provided sources/passage conveys.
###### Rhetorical Choices
- **Comparison –** a metaphor or analogy present in the introduction that the writer revisits in the conclusion
- **Detail/Description –** this is one my creative writers gravitate toward
- **Definition –** defining terms, especially in an introductory paragraph, can be a helpful way to set parameters, especially in argument and synthesis
###### Word Choice, Punctuation, & Varied Syntax
adverbs, adjectives, synonyms
###### Examine tensions within the rhetorical situation
“why this choice for this audience on this occasion?”
###### Examine structure
Divide the passage into (commonly) three sections, which will help students understand the structure of the passage.
