Force & Potential Energy of Gravity
$$\begin{align}
F_{g}&=G\frac{Mm}{r^2} =mg
\end{align}$$
> Choosing the convention that K=0 makes calculations simpler, albeit at the cost of making U negative. Note that in this case the potential energy becomes zero when r is infinite, and approaches negative infinity as r goes to zero.
