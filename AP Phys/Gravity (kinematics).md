Force & Potential Energy of Gravity
$$\begin{align}
F_{g}&=G\frac{Mm}{r^2} =mg
\end{align}$$
> Choosing the convention that K=0 makes calculations simpler, albeit at the cost of making U negative. Note that in this case the potential energy becomes zero when r is infinite, and approaches negative infinity as r goes to zero.

Gravity acting parallel to slope: `F = mg sin(θ)`
Gravity acting perp to slope: `F⊥ = mg cos(θ)` (presses the object to the slope)

If a 10 kg object is on a slope with a 30-degree angle, the force of gravity acting parallel to the slope would be F = (10 kg) * (9.8 m/s²) * sin(30°) = 49 N
