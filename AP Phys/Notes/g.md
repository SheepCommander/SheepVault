F_g = mg = G Mm / r^2
G = 6.67E-11 m^2/kg^2
Elipse = Parabola
F_g = mv^2 / r

Earth is not always the same distance away in orbit
Earth does not move at the same speed throughout hte orbit
Farther u are from object longer it takes to complete an orbit

(elipse: some portions closer radius so same t = further traveled)

TK: I NEED TO REVIEW GRAVITY
