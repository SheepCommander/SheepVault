The knowledge test is used to ensure you understand road
signs, traffic laws, and safe-driving practices before you drive
on the roadways. Everything you must learn to pass the
test is in this guide. You may take the test at any approved
driver training school in the state. If you take your test at a
driver licensing office that offers testing, it will be taken on
a computer unless you need special accommodation. It is a
multiple-choice test with 40 questions, and you must correctly
answer 32 of them to pass the test. A passing test score is good
for two years.
