$$\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx}x=1 && \frac{d}{dx}y&=1*y' \\
\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x &  & \frac{d}{dx}y^2 &=2y*y' \\
\frac{d}{dx}e^{5x}=5e^{5x} &  & \frac{d}{dx}e^{5y}&=5e^{5y}*y'
\end{align}$$
1. Take the derivative. Each time the derivative of "y" is involved, include a dy/dx
2. Gather all terms with dy/dx on the left side, everything else on the right.
3. Factor out the dy/dx if necessary, to create only one dy/dx term.
4. Solve for dy/dx

Horizontal and Vertical Tangent Lines
- Horizontal tangent lines exist when the slope, dy/dx = **0**
- Vertical tangent lines exist when the slope, dy/dx is **undefined**
