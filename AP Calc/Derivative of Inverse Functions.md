$$\begin{align}
g'(x)=(f^{-1})'(x)&=\frac{1}{f'(g(x))} \\
g'(x)&=\frac{1}{f'(y)}
\end{align}$$

Remember from precalculus that a **one-to-one** function passes the horizontal and vertical line test and that we can restrict the domain of f(x) to make its inverse a function, ex: $\sin(x); -\pi/2 \leq x \leq \pi/2$

Also recall that an inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ is the reflection of $f(x)$ over the line $y=x$.

Consider f(x) = x^2 + 1, x>=0 and its inverse f^-1(x) = sqrt(x-1)

Graph each
Find the derivative of each
Find f(2) and f^-1(5)
Find f'(2) and (f^-1)'(5)
What did you notice about the slopes from part d?

**Big ideas**
1. Inverse functions have reciprocal slopes at reflected points
2. Formula for derivative of an inverse at a point. g'(x) = 1/{f'(g(x))}
