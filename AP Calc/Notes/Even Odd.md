- Even functions are reflected across the y-axis.
- Odd functions are symmetrical over either y=x or y=-x

Even functions multiplied or added together are still even.

$x^2+1$  is even!
> exponents of x are 2 and 0, both even!

$x^3 + x$  is odd!
> exponents of x are 3 and 1, both odd!

$x^2 + x$  is not odd or even.
> they need to all be even or odd!!

> A function $f$ is **even** if for all $x$ in its domain,
$f(-x) = f(x)$.
A function $f$ is **odd** if for all $x$ in its domain,
$f(-x) = -f(x)$.
