If a function $f$ is continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ then there exists a point $c$ within that open interval where the instantaneous rate of change equals the average rate of change over the interval.
$$\begin{align}
\text{If: } \\
&f\text{ is continuous [a,b]} \\
&f\text{ is differentiable over (a,b)} \\ \\
\text{Then:} \\
&f'(c)= \frac{{f(b)-f(a)}}{b-a}
\end{align}$$
There exists a $c$ where $f'(c)=$ the average rate of change

# MVT vs IVT
MVT:
- The derivative (instantaneous rate of change) must equal the average rate of change somewhere in the differentiable interval (a,b)
IVT:
- ON a given continuous interval, you will have a y-value at each of the end points of the interval. Every y-value exists between these two y-values at least once in the interval.
